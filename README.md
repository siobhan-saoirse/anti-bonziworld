# Anti-BonziWORLD Browser Extension
The GitHub repository for the Anti-BonziWORLD add-on / extension, based off of Konnor88's impressive browser extension named Anti-Grabify. 

It blocks almost anything from the far-right side of BW from being visited due to how it promotes hate, misinformation and many terrible things that shouldn't be tolerated in today's society.

Protect yourself from the far-right side of BonziWORLD. Download the extension today!
